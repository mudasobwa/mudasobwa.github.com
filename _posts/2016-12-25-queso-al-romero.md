A friend of my wife, visiting us in Barcelona, accidentally asked me “Where should
I buy the famous cheese with rosmarinus?”—In fact, she did not literally said
“famous,” but I got her speaking that way. We were living in Barcelona for
almost two years already and it was a bit offensive that I have never heard about
“cheese with rosmarinus.”

I went to the [Boqueria Mercat](http://www.boqueria.info/mercat-benvinguts.php)
and bought some for the guest of Barcelona.

We live near [El Putxet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Putget_i_Farr%C3%B3),
where rosmarinus is growing up in the natural wild thickets. The last time I
had a promenade there, I eventually understood I should give a try to producing
this “cheese with rosmarinus” at home. Don’t ask; I love crazy ideas and I tend
to accomplish any coming to my head.

There are basically two mainstream kinds of this cheese:
[Cabra al Romero](https://www.gourmet-food.com/spanish-cheese/cabra-al-romero-cheese-101143.aspx)
and [Romao Cheese](https://www.gourmet-food.com/spanish-cheese/romao-cheese-1000289.aspx).
The difference is the former is produced from goat’s milk and the latter—from cow’s.
So I went to the supermarket and bought the one made from the mixed milk, sheep’s included.

Also I bought rosmarinus, estragon and dill, the pergament paper and the
bags with a zipper. Here I started:

Honestly, this cheese was as tasty as the one the human being can buy for money,
even better. So I suggest you to write this recipe down and try yourself: it’s
easy and it worth the efforts put into.

Get three sheets of the pergament paper, sprinkle it abundantly with species
(more rosemarin, less estragon, less dill.) If you have the grains of coriander,
put them there as well.

![Preparation: Ingredients](/img/cheese/2.png)

Place the cheese head in the middle of that spicy lawn.

Roll the cheese head in the species. It should be covered with as thick layer
of dried herbs, as possible.

As think as possible, I have said!

![Preparation: Ingredients](/img/cheese/5.png)

Wrap the cheese with pergament sheets; 7–8 sheets would be enough.

Put it in the bag, zip it, and put the pack in another one zipped bag.

You are all done! Now place the bag in the fridge for one month. To get
the cheese “more aged,” one might change the pergament papers past two weeks,
they will collect the moisture out of the cheese and become wet; decreasing
the humidity in the package will make the cheese tasting more cured.

After one month (6 weeks are even better,) your “famous cheese with rosmarinus”
is ready. ¡Que aproveche!
