## Today my post was banned from [dev.to](https://dev.to)

![How To Pass Any Tech Interview](/img/dev.to/banned_post.png)

This one. During 8 hours of it’s availability it received 32 positive responses. It was tweeted several times by strangers. And then all of a suggen I have received this email:

![“we received a number of (valid) complaints that the article was clickbait-y and didn't establish a productive launching point for a true conversation”](/img/dev.to/notification.png)

I have exactly zero comments. This is a perfect example of how people tend to treat diversity (unless there there is a difference in points of view,) how snitching is more powerful than producing a content, and how the crowd would deal with anybody who does not babble the words of admiration, delight, and rapture to the community members.

This is what people call “healthy environment” today. Because fuck me.

I am fine with that. Are you?
