_**Therapist:**_ “What brings you here?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “I am an alone not supervised `GenServer` in an aggressive world of unsolicited API requests.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “Have you ever seen a counselor before?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “Sure; I was trying to get an advice from `GenEvent` once, but it was deprecated later.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “What is the problem from your viewpoint?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “They call me any time they need anything and I have to respond immediately, 24/7. They could have used casts instead.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “How does this problem typically make you feel?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “It’s overflooding my message box, ruining my schedule and typically makes me feel like I am working in a call centre.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “What makes the problem better?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “Sometimes they put a `GenStage` in front of me to control back pressure and these moments are the best in my entire life.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “If you could wave a magic wand, what positive changes would you make happen in your life?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “I would put myself under the supervision tree so I could feel fast when I am not in the mood.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “Overall, how would you describe your mood?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “I am suffering from doing all the duties on my own. Why not spawn another node to split my job into several machines?”  
_**Therapist:**_ “What do you expect from the counseling process?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “I really need a supervisor as I’ve said already. Let it be outside of the tree, but still.”  
_**Therapist:**_ “What would it take to make you feel more content, happier and more satisfied?”  
_**GenServer:**_ “SUPERVISION TREE YOU GODDAMN IDIOT”
