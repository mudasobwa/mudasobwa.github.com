When I was a kid, we had too few influential opinions: “Dad says,”
“Britannica states” and “I’ve tried, it hurts.”

Seriously, teachers were not just throwing their private opinions on things onto us;
Newton laws were not shared through 140-symbols message one Saturday’s evening.
There were lemmas, theorems and they all were proven. The only thing that was
given to us as a must, was an axiomatics. And you know what? The amount of
axioms, needed to derive and prove _everything else_ in Euclid’s geometry, is five.

Nowadays we have many more authorities. Many more axiomatics. Many more
postulates in each.

Since currently I mostly work with Ruby, I will provide the examples from the Ruby
world, but I believe they are applicable to almost any other area of choice.
Including fashion, copywriting, food, younameit.

There is a tendency to listen to what people we respect use to say. Which is good.
In the modern era, any random phrase, occasionally dropped in any bloated
discussion immediately becomes public. Which is bad.

This happens because arguing is being done through the web, in shared access mode.
When an arbitrary Einstein had accidentally had said gibberish (which I believe
happened to him quite often,) it was not spread immediately over the millions
of followers.

When an arbitrary DHH has had behaved the same way, it is. Less famous people
take any word from there as a word of Holy Truth, carved in stone. There is
the only problem with this approach: people can not constantly say wise things.
Those who do rare _do_ wise things and they never become opinion makers.

Turning back to Ruby, now there is a trend to talk about “monkeypatching is an evil,”
“the code must be as clear as possible,” “never use `eval`, it hurts” etc. These
things are being repeated as a mantra, as a spell to cast to call the Gods of
the great code.

The above is a bullshit.

Whether the developer is so dumb, that it needs to be guarded by artificial
restrictions, she should go switch to go (excuse me :) or use any other technique
to improve the skills. Cutting ruby’s natural beauty by suppressing the greatest
features like monkeypatching, re-opening classes and family is kinda
_security by obscurity_. It is hazardous, because developers become even more
stupid than they are currently. The only way to improve the code quality is
to choose the language that one feels comfortable with and then use all the features
it provides. That’s how things work. Nobody buys a Ferrary F-50 to drive at most
50 MpH just because _it’s dangerous_. Those _bewarers_ buy Fiat 500, and that
is the right choice.

But wait, one meticulous reader should ask me here. John A., Jack B. and even
Joanne R. said we should not use `eval`. Well, `GOTO 1`, please.
