=== Linux

**Q.** I’m stuck with installation of `best-lib-ever` of version `1.2.3`, needed to
convert integer value to string? I have tried
to install library from sources, following to _this_ and _this_ blog posts with no success
(error message follows). I also have _this_, _this_ and _this_ related posts read.
I have tried to uninstall/reinstall `better-lib-ever` with no luck. According to _this_,
I might have a problem with `another-best-lib`, but that’s not my case (test follows.)
As a last try I created a fully fresh installation within virtual machine (config follows,)
but still have the same problem (memory dump follows.)

**A.** Where the f×ck did you dig that piece of shit? Why not use the standard `int_to_str`?

=== MacOSX

**Q.** I met the following problem on my _OSX Lion_. After I have successfuly installed
`best-lib-ever`, the `web-server-of-choice` prints warning messages during startup (messages
follow.) I tried to remove `best-lib-ever` and now server starts without problems.
I still need `best-lib-ever`, so the question is: how am I supposed to install `best-lib-ever`
so that the web server will not be damaged.

**A.** _Here_ is a solution (summing up: you are not supposed to install `best-lib-ever` near
the `web-server-of-choice`.)

=== Windows

**Q.** I have tried to install `best-development-tool` and nothing works. Please help!

**A.** Install `mingw` and follow the instructions _here_.
