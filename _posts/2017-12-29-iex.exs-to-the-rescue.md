My development cycle looks like:

    invent feature ⇒ write test ⇒ implement everything
                                      ⇓           ⇑
                               hack in iex    write more tests
                                      ⇓           ⇑
                                     make tests pass

Right now I’m going to talk about “hack in `iex`” part. If you are like me,
you probably have a good `seeds.exs` file that feeds the `dev` database with
everything it needs, but... occasionally you tweak the data, and you don’t
need a fresh start, and every new single console session starts with annoying
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> history searches for the data manipulations.

BTW, it you still have no history in your `iex` console, you are going to
upgrade Erlang to version 20 and issue

    export ERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"

somewhere inside your `.zsh.after`, or `.bashrc`, or even some fishy script.
If you are somehow stuck to erlang version less than 20, check
[this link](https://github.com/ferd/erlang-history). History is a must,
no doubt. There is [more on enabling history in `IEx` documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html#module-shell-history).

Turning back to `iex`, one might want to produce a temporary _seed_, that after
the hacking session might be moved to `seeds.exs` file. To do so, just
create a `.iex.exs` file in the project root directory and put any elixir
code you want to get executed when the console starts.

Before we continue with the main example, let me introduce my own `.iex.exs`
file, because it actually has both project-related and system-wide
configurations.

```elixir
global_settings = "~/.iex.exs"
if File.exists?(global_settings), do: Code.require_file(global_settings)

Application.put_env(:elixir, :ansi_enabled, true)
IEx.configure(
 colors: [
   eval_result: [:cyan, :bright] ,
   eval_error: [[:red, :bright, "\n▶▶▶\n"]],
   eval_info: [:yellow, :bright ],
 ],
 default_prompt: [
   "\e[G", # cursor ⇒ column 1
    :blue, "%prefix", :yellow, "|", :blue, "%counter", " ", :yellow, "▶", :reset
  ] |> IO.ANSI.format |> IO.chardata_to_string
)

alias MyApp.{Repo,User,Photo,Album}
[am] = Repo.all User
```

First two lines enforce the system-wide configuration to be used as
“overridable defaults” here. For instance, the whole `IEx.configure` part
might be moved there if you are OK with having same settings for all
the projects.

My advise would be: invent the prompt shape you like and put
_the `default_prompt`_ part to system-wide `~/.iex.exs`. Don't be lazy to
tune up _different colors_ for each project. That way you’ll never lose
the point on what project this console is opened for. If you are working
on one project at any moment, you might want to put the whole `IEx`
configuration into system-wide file.

So far so good. This is how my prompt looks like:

![iex 1>](/img/20171229-1.jpg)

One might see the bright red error message. That is configured by
`[colors: [eval_error: ...]]` setting. Everything else is pretty
self-explanatory. OK, when we have things tuned up, let’s tweak our project.

When I start to work on some feature, I might need some very filtered set
of the data in `dev` environment, not the wholy load of everything from
`seeds.exs`. I usually start with creating some new data by typing in a console
and as soon as I find myself re-evaluating the same line of code from
the history more and more, I put the respective line into my project’s `.iex.exs`
file. Or, I might do some clean up after last console session there.

In the example I provided above, last two lines are aliasing _everything_
for my current project _and_ assign the first available user instance from the
database to the variable named `am`. In some projects I have dozens of lines
there. For some projects I do not bother to create this file at all, relying
on the system-wide one.
